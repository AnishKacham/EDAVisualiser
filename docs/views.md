# Views
The [views](views.md) just wraps the building blocks into a specific use-case.

## ApplicationView
This view is centralizing everything around the applications. What is sends and what it receives and who interact with it.

## ApplicationFocusView
This view is centralizing everything around a single application, where it shows connections to external applications.

## SystemView
This view is focused on the larger picture, how applications interact with each other within a system.
